                        To begin, select a type of tableau for your output, using the radio buttons.&nbsp;
                        Selecting a radio button will change the type used in subsequent runs of the algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The page can be used in two ways.&nbsp;
                        First, you can have the page generate a random signed permutation.&nbsp;
                        To do that, enter the size of the desired permutation in the first textbox.&nbsp;
                        Then click one of the two buttons directly to the right.&nbsp;
                        The Run button will display a randomly-generated signed permutation and the output of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm when applied to that permutation.&nbsp;
                        Alternatively, the Run Steps button will also generate a random signed permutation, and will show you the intermediate steps of applying the Robinson-Schensted algorithm to that permutation.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Instead, you can enter a permutation in the second textbox.&nbsp;
                        To do that, list the (positive and negative) numbers of the signed permutation, separated by spaces.&nbsp;
                        Then, use the Run or Run Steps buttons to the right of that box, as above.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Pressing Enter while in one of these two textboxes will click the Run button to the right.&nbsp;
                        Pressing a button a second time, or a different button, will clear the previous result as it gives you a new result, as will pressing Enter while in a textbox.
                </p>

        <div class="infoDiv" id="InformationDiv" style="display:none">
                <p>
                        This page displays the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm.&nbsp;
                        The Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm is a relatively straightforward generalization of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm to the hyperoctrahedral group, that is, the group of signed permutations.&nbsp;
                        The input to the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm is a "signed permutation", for example, 2 -5 3 6 -4 1.&nbsp;
                        That is, the numbers 1 through n are permuted, and, in addition, each number has a sign (or orientation) associated with it.&nbsp;
                        The output of the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm is a pair of domino tableaux with the same shape.&nbsp;
                        That is, instead of a tableau being made of squares, it is made of 2 x 1 shapes (dominos), which can be horizontal or vertical in the tableau.&nbsp; However, unlike the dominos in a game, each domino has only one number in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                        As in the original Robinson-Schensted algorithm, the left tableau is the insertion, or bumping tableau.&nbsp;
                        The right tableau is the recording tableau.&nbsp;
                        In this algorithm, insertion is either as a horizontal domino in the first row, if the number in the signed permutation is positive, or as a vertical domino in the first column, if the number in the signed permutation is positive.&nbsp;
                        Bumping is also more complicated.&nbsp;
                        A horizontal domino which is bumped entirely moves to the next row below.&nbsp;
                        A vertical domino which is bumped entirely moves to the next column to the right.&nbsp;
                        A domino which is bumped in one square rotates down and to the right on its unbumped square.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                        After a domino is added to the insertion tableau by this procedure, the resulting change to the shape of the insertion tableau is two squares, adjacent either horizontally or vertically.&nbsp;
                        A domino is then added to the recording tableau to record this change.
                </p>
                <p>
                        You can see an animation of the bumping procedure here:&nbsp;  <a  href="https://devragj.github.io/TypeBCD/DominoRobinsonSchenstedAnimate.html" target="_blank">Domino Robinson-Schensted Algorithm Animated</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Domino tableaux are used to answer questions about simple Lie groups of type B, C, or D.&nbsp;
                        To use a domino tableau for a question about a Lie group of a specific type, you need to place the tableau on the grid associated to that type.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                        The B grid is associated with the group SO(2n + 1).&nbsp;
                        Selecting the B grid will run the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm algorithm starting with two tableaux with zeros in their top-left corner.&nbsp;
                        In that way, the resulting tableaux are made of 2n + 1 squares.
                </p>
