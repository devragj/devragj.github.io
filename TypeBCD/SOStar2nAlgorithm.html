                        The page can be used in two ways.&nbsp;
                        First, you can have the page generate a random input parameter.&nbsp;
                        To do that, enter the size of the parameter in the first textbox.&nbsp;
                        Optionally, enter the number of pairs in the parameter in the second textbox.&nbsp;
                        The number of pairs should be less than or equal to half the number chosen for n.
                </p>
                <p>
                        After entering this information, click one of the two buttons directly to the right.&nbsp;
                        The Run button will display a randomly-generated parameter and the output of the SO*(2n) Algorithm when applied to that parameter.&nbsp;
                        Alternatively, the Run Steps button will also generate a random parameter, and will show you the intermediate steps of applying the SO*(2n) Algorithm to that parameter.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Pressing Enter while in one of the textboxes will click the Run button to the right.&nbsp;
                        Pressing a button a second time, or a different button, will clear the previous result as it gives you a new result, as will pressing Enter while in a textbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                        You can also enter an input parameter in the textbox labelled "parameter".&nbsp;
                        A parameter is an arrangement of the numbers 1 through n, where each number is either a singleton or paired with another number.&nbsp;
                        Any singleton number has a sign associated to it, either + or -.&nbsp;
                        In addition, each pair has a sign (or orientation) associated with it.&nbsp;
                        For example, this is a parameter: 1+ 3- 2_-5 6+ 4_7 for SO*(14).&nbsp;
                        The _ is used to indicate a pair of numbers.&nbsp;
                        If a pair has the negative orientation, then the second number in the pair is written with a - sign.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                        To enter a parameter in the parameter textbox, write the parameter as in the example, with spaces separating the pieces of the parameter.&nbsp;
                        Then, use the Run or Run Steps buttons to the right of that box, as above.

                        This page displays the algorithm for computing annihilators and associated varieties for irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for SO*(2n).&nbsp;
                        This algorithm is essentially the same algorithm which is used to compute annihilators and associated varieties for Sp(p,q).&nbsp;
                        I recommend looking at the Sp(p,q) algorithm first, because it is the more basic version of the algorithm.&nbsp;
                        See <a href="https://devragj.github.io/TypeBCD/SppqAlgorithm.html" target="_blank">https://devragj.github.io/TypeBCD/SppqAlgorithm.html</a> for the Sp(p,q) algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The input to the SO*(2n) algorithm is a parameter for the irreducible Harish-Chandra module.&nbsp;
                        For the purposes of this algorithm, a parameter takes the form of an arrangement of the numbers 1, ..., n, where each number is either a singleton or paired with another number.&nbsp;
                        Any singleton number has a sign associated to it, either + or -.&nbsp;
                        In addition, each pair has a sign (or orientation) associated with it.&nbsp;
                        So, for example, this is a parameter: 1+ 3- 2_-5 6+ 4_7.&nbsp;
                        The _ is used to indicate a pair of numbers.&nbsp;
                        If a pair has the negative orientation, then the second number in the pair is written with a - sign.&nbsp;
                        So, the example above is a parameter for SO*(14).
                </p>
                <p>
                        A parameter is determined by its pieces (that is, the number/sign combinations and number/number pairs).&nbsp;
                        Unlike in a permutation, the order of the pieces doesn't matter.&nbsp;
                        We will list the pieces in increasing numerical order, where this increasing order disregards the first number of any number pair, and just uses the second number to find its place.&nbsp;
                        (The example parameter above is in this order.)&nbsp;
                        The pieces of the parameter are used by the algorithm in this order.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The output of the SO*(2n) algorithm is a pair of tableaux.&nbsp;
                        The left tableau is a domino tableau with numbers, just as in the output to the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm.&nbsp;
                        The left tableaux which are output by this algorithm have the additional property that the number of rows of any give length is even.&nbsp;
                        The right tableau is a sign tableau, which is used by the algorithm, and also can be used to derive the associated variety of the irreducible Harish-Chandra module.&nbsp;
                        More precisely, the output of the algorithm is an equivalence class of such pairs of tableaux, with a somewhat complicated equivalence relationship.&nbsp;
                        With this equivalence relationship, the algorithm is a bijection.&nbsp;
                        The left tableau of the output corresponds to the primitive ideal which is the annihilator of the irreducible Harish-Chandra module associated to the parameter.&nbsp;
                        The right tableau describes the associated variety of this Harish-Chandra module.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Each of the two tableaux is presented on a grid of 2x2 squares.&nbsp;
                        This grid is an important feature of the algorithm.&nbsp;
                        It shows when a tableau shape is special, as well as how to go from special to non-special configurations of the number tableau, when required by the algorithm.&nbsp;
                        SO*(2n) is of type D, and so for this algorithm, the left tableau is in the D position with respect to the grid.&nbsp;
                        In the D position, the top-left corner of the tableau is in the top-right corner of a 2x2 square of the grid.&nbsp;
                        However, the sign tableau is in the C position with respect to the grid (just as in the Sp(p,q) algorithm.)&nbsp;
                        In the C position, the top-left corner of the tableau is in the top-left corner of a 2x2 square of the grid.&nbsp;
                        The algorithm requires that the end of the corresponding rows of the two tableaux be in the same position with respect to the grid.&nbsp; To achieve this, the algorithm acts as if the first column of the sign tableau is an infinite column of signed dominos (with infinitely many of each sign available.)&nbsp;
                        Once you have this set up, the actual procedure of the SO*(2n) algorithm is the same as that of the Sp(p,q) algorithm.
